##### This repo contains a LaTex template for MSc/PhD/MPhil/MRes/EngD students in the school of Computer Science at The University of Manchester (UoM).


The template is based on an [original template](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/latex/MUThesis/) by Graham Gough and optimized a bit in the following points:
- More clear directory structure
- Used Harvard Reference Style
- Provided an instruction on counting words
- Add .gitignore to ignore certain files

I hope this template make you more convenient:).
